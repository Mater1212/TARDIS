The overall purpose of UGA Event Hub is to provide UGA students and
staff with a centralized platform to discover, create, and manage campus and local events.

Our website ensures this by verifying users through a login system as well as sending a multifactor
verification e-mail to their provided UGA e-mail on sign up. This insurer that all users creating and editing events
are part of the UGA community giving added security for users registering with these events. Furthermore, our web page has a view
for non-registered/verified users allowing them to see created events. But registered/verified users we'll be able to RSVP into created
events. As well as having the ability to create, edit, and delete their own events.

When it comes to user profiles. Our users can view their profile, see what events they have created, and look at all their
events they have registered for. With the dedicated three-tab layout, your profiles tab is a dedicated space for information about your account.

For a registered user we also have a dedicated add event tab allowing quick and easy set up for our users to add events to our event hub. Users will be able
to specify the event location, number of attendees, title, description, and an image URL to be displayed.
