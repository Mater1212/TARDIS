The overall purpose of the UGA Event Hub is to provide UGA students and
Staff with a centralized platform to discover, create, and manage campus and local events.

Our website ensures this by verifying users through a login system as well as sending a multifactor
verification e-mail to their provided UGA e-mail on sign-up. This ensures that all users creating and editing events
are part of the UGA community, giving added security for users registering for these events. Furthermore, our web page has a view
for non-registered/verified users, allowing them to see the created events. But registered/verified users will be able to RSVP for the created
events. As well as having the ability to create, edit, and delete their own events.

When it comes to user profiles. Our users can view their profile, see what events they have created, and look at all their
events they have registered for. With the dedicated three-tab layout, your profiles tab is a dedicated space for information about your account.

For a registered user, we also have a dedicated add event tab, allowing quick and easy setup for our users to add events to our event hub. Users will be able
to specify the event location, number of attendees, title, description, and an image URL to be displayed.
